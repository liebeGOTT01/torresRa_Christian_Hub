                    several, there is that pull to withdraw and walk with God alone. However, there is value in being a
                    part of a living and growing body of Christ that is beyond measure. And it is essential for being
                    the person God has called you to be.</em>

                <br><br>
                <p>Can I walk with God alone? It is important to recognize just what is meant by this question. At its
                    heart is the concept of walking with God; to be in an active and growing relationship with God. Can
                    I have that relationship with God apart from being in a community of believers? In other words, is
                    it possible to be a Lone Ranger type of Christian?</p>
                <br>


                <h2>Why Would This Question Even Come Up?</h2>
                <br>
                <p> There are a couple of reasons why someone might ask this question. The first is because they are
                    living in isolation from other believers. There are places in the world that are hostile to faith
                    in Christ. Or that faith is not practiced. And in those cases, the one who comes to faith will find
                    themselves unable to join with other believers. Will they be unable to effectively walk with God?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The other reason is likely more common. A person has had a bad experience with a local church, and
                    maybe several of them. And, as a result, they have withdrawn from what they call the organized
                    church. They have not rejected faith in God, and still want to walk with Him. But they are no
                    longer interested in being a part of a community of believers. Will they be unable to effectively
                    walk with God?</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Community of Believers</h2>
                <br>
                <p>It is worthwhile looking at what is meant here by being a part of a community of believers. I am
                    not referring to simply attending a local church and participating in some of its activities. That
                    is not bad, but it is not enough.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We are called on to be more than a loose collection of individuals who gather weekly. In John
                    17:20-21, we find Jesus praying for those who would believe because of the message of his apostles;
                    that’s us. And in this prayer, he says, “I pray also for those who will believe in me through their
                    message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.” His prayer is
                    that we may be united as believers. That we might be one. In similar fashion to the unity enjoyed
                    within the Trinity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We might identify a number of things Jesus came to do, especially redemption and reconciliation.
                    But among them was the establishment of a new covenant people. Jesus’ prayer, and expectation, for
                    His people is that we be one. And that is not compatible with walking alone. We are to walk
                    together.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What Does the Bible Teach?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>One of the most explicit calls in the Scripture to be in community is found in Hebrews 10:24-25.
                    “And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up
                    meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another — and all the more
                    as you see the Day approaching.” Some, even in the earliest church, seem to have given up meeting
                    with other believers. They had left the community of faith. And the author of Hebrews encourages
                    those who remain to continue meeting together.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Why? To encourage each other. They were living in a time and place where it was challenging to be
                    believers. While together, they could encourage each other to continue faithfully.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And, while they are together, they can “spur one another on toward love and good deeds.” This goes
                    beyond simple encouragement to continue faithfulness. This looks at challenging each other to be
                    growing in the faith and in fruitfulness. And it carries with it a note of accountability. That is
                    all lacking when we do not meet together in community.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Advantage of Community</h2>
                <br>
                <p>What are the advantages of being a part of a community of faith? Some have been mentioned above,
                    but below are five advantages of walking with God in community with other believers:</p>
                <br>
                <p>We can encourage each other. We all need encouragement from time to time. Especially to be
                    encouraged to walk faithfully with God. To be involved in spiritual disciplines. And to lift us up
                    when we have fallen or are in a low place.
                    To hold each other accountable. Accountability is not something that we typically value. But it is
                    important. It definitely helps me to be more disciplined when I know that others will be holding me
                    accountable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Corporate worship is important. Yes, I can, and do, worship out in the creation. And I find it
                    enriching and valuable. But worshiping together with other believers is also beneficial. Corporate
                    worship, if it is genuine and God focused, is something that I cannot duplicate when by myself.
                    Worshiping with others enhances my own worship experience.
                    Sharing together in Bible Study. I study the Bible more by myself than I do with others. But that
                    corporate Bible study is important. Sharing and the discussion helps me to stay centered. And I
                    find that I actually go deeper in the Word when doing it with others. Their questions and comments
                    draw me deeper into the Word.</p>
                <br>
                <p>God has called us to be a part of the body of Christ. And he has uniquely equipped each of us to
                    serve within the body. If I am not a part of a body, and serving appropriately, then I am hurting
                    the body. As well, if I am not a part of a body, then I am missing out on the other gifting God has
                    given that body. I am like an eye that has nobody to provide sight for, or to receive support from.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The Disadvantage of Going it Alone</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In addition to missing out on the advantages listed above, attempting to “go it alone” in your
                    relationship with God carries with it the following disadvantages:</p>
                <br>
                <p>We are acting in disobedience to Scriptural instruction to join with other believers. Can I really
                    expect to walk in union with God when I am not in union with the body of Christ?
                    What happens when I fall, or when doubt comes my way? Most of us will likely experience doubt in
                    our faith, often more than once. If there is no one around to help, even indirectly, it can be
                    challenging to overcome it.<br><br>
                    You will never reach your true potential as a child of God apart from the body of Christ. We are
                    called to work, grow, and serve together. It is not enough to simply have a personal relationship
                    with God.</p><br>

                <h2>The Value of Community</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Can you follow God apart from a community of believers? It is possible, especially if there are no
                    other believers where you are. And if that is the case God will provide for you in other ways.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But if you are among those who are “burnt out” on church, I would encourage you to not just drop
                    out and go it on your own. The value of being a part of a living and growing body of Christ is
                    beyond measure. And it is essential for being the person God has called you to be.
