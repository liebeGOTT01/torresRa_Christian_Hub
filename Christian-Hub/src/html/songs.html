                            The Bible speaks of two men, who were standing in the field.
                            Where one is taken and one is left behind.
                            Two women in the kitchen one goes and one remains.
                            So get your house in order while there's time.
                            In the cross there is salvation, through the blood there is a way, to secure your
                            destination on that resurrection day.
                            Are you ready for the trumpet?
                            Are you ready for the call?
                            Soon the angels will assemble to usher in the Son of God.
                            Will He come and find you faithful?
                            Will He know your name at all?
                            Every moment brings us closer.
                            Are you ready for the call?
                            There's an ergancy to reach the world.
                            We have no time to waist.
                            For within the heart of mortal man the burning question now is raised.
                            Are you ready for the trumpet?
                            Are you ready for the call?
                            Soon the angels will assemble to usher in the Son of God.

                            What heights of love, what depths of peace<br>

                            And did my life reflect the glory of your Spirit?<br>
                            And did I show the ones around me they were loved?<br><br>
                            When the world looks at me do they see Jesus?<br>
                            When the world looks at me what do they see?<br>

                            I could maybe impress you<br>
                            With tender words and a harmony<br>
                            A clever rhyme or two<br>
                            But if all I've done in the time we've shared<br>
                            Is turn your eyes on me<br>
                            Then I've failed at what I've been called to do<br>
                            There's someone else I want you to see

                            When we go our different ways
                            When this moment is a memory

                            You sensed His love more than you did before

                            I'd like to keep these memories
                            In frames of gold and silver
                            And reminisce a year from now
                            About the smiles we've shared
                            But above all else I hope you will come
                            To know the Father's love
                            When you see the Lord face to face
                            You'll hear Him say "well done"
