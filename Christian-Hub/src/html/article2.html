                <br>
                <br>
                <em class="font-weight-light">"Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so
                    that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all
                    the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground'” (Genesis 1:26). In the
                    first chapter of the Bible, we see the Trinity at play. By Trinity, we mean that although our God
                    is one, three persons make up the Godhead: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.</em>
                <br><br>
                <img src="../images/pass.jpg" class="articPic">
                <br><br>
                <p>As Christians, we believe in one God, so why does he refer to himself in the plural in verses such
                    as Genesis 1:26 and Genesis 3:22? Some Jewish commentators have suggested that when God said, “Let
                    us make man in our image”, he was also speaking to the angels, but that’s not likely the case in
                    this narrative.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, in Genesis 1:26 and Genesis 3:22, God uses the name “Elohim” in reference to himself.
                    This has a plural meaning. So, if our God is one (Deuteronomy 6:4), how does this compute? Why
                    would a singular God refer to himself in the plural? And what does this mean for us today?</p>
                <br><br>


                <h2>In the Beginning Was the Trinity</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p> Even in the first chapter of the Bible, we see the Trinity at play. By Trinity, we mean that
                    although our God is one, three persons make up the Godhead: God the Father (Matthew 6:26), God the
                    Son (John 3:16), and God the Holy Spirit (John 14:16).
                    <br><br>
                    Although we never see the term “Trinity” in Scripture, the Bible makes it clear that God is three
                    in one. Centuries of church debate, from the beginning, have tried to settle on a way to understand
                    how God can be three in one.
                    <br><br>
                    We do have to understand, from our human perspective, we can never fully comprehend the nature of
                    an omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient God. His ways are not ours (Isaiah 55:8-9). However, for
                    a great resource on the Trinity, check out Nabeel Qureshi’s Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus.
                    <br><br>
                    But why would God need to operate in this way? Think about it like this. If God is plural, three in
                    one, God is not lonely. Therefore, when he created, he did so as an outpouring of his love, not out
                    of necessity to appease his boredom or loneliness.
                    <br><br>
                    If God was one in one, he would be dependent on his creation (dependent on them to either entertain
                    him, relieve his boredom or loneliness, or carry out tasks for him like slaves). That’s not a
                    loving, all-powerful God. That’s a needy, selfish God. However, because the Trinity exists, God
                    doesn’t need humans. Yet, he created us anyway as an act of love.
                    <br><br></p>
                <h2>Meaning and Importance for Christians Today
                    Why do we need to know the nature of God?</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>First, God wants to have a relationship with us (Romans 5:8). Any time we want to strengthen a
                    relationship, we have to learn more about the other person. Knowing the nature of God can
                    strengthen our understanding of him and relationship with him.
                    <br><br>
                    Second, we can see hints of a Gospel thread even in the very beginning. God the Father, Son, and
                    Spirit all participated in every part of the story of humanity, even creation (Genesis 1:2). And
                    all parts of the Godhead are still active in our lives today. God the Father didn’t quit after the
                    Old Testament, and God the Son didn’t stop his job when he ascended into heaven. And God the Holy
                    Spirit didn’t start his job at Pentecost. God was active in the beginning, continues to be active,
                    and will persist in doing so for all eternity.
                    <br><br>
                    Third, we have a God who created us as an act of love. God doesn’t need us, but he decided the
                    world could use a little bit of each and every one of us. How amazing that we have a God who isn’t
                    dependent on us, yet still wants to have a relationship with each and every human being!
