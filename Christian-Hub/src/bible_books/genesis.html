                                    1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
                                    <br><br>
                                    2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
                                    deep.
                                    And
                                    the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
                                    <br><br>
                                    3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
                                    <br><br>
                                    4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the
                                    darkness.
                                    <br><br>
                                    5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening
                                    and
                                    the
                                    morning were the first day.
                                    <br><br>
                                    6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it
                                    divide
                                    the
                                    waters from the waters.
                                    <br><br>
                                    7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament
                                    from
                                    the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
                                    <br><br>
                                    8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the
                                    second
                                    day.
                                    <br><br>
                                    9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one
                                    place,
                                    and
                                    let the dry land appear: and it was so.
                                    <br><br>
                                    10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters
                                    called
                                    he
                                    Seas: and God saw that it was good.
                                    <br><br>
                                    11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
                                    fruit
                                    tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it
                                    was
                                    so.
                                    <br><br>
                                    12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and
                                    the
                                    tree
                                    yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was
                                    good.
                                    <br><br>
                                    13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.
                                    <br><br>
                                    14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the
                                    day
                                    from
                                    the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
                                    <br><br>
                                    15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the
                                    earth:
                                    and it was so.
                                    <br><br>
                                    16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser
                                    light
                                    to rule the night: he made the stars also.
                                    <br><br>
                                    17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
                                    <br><br>
                                    18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the
                                    darkness:
                                    and God saw that it was good.
                                    <br><br>
                                    19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
                                    <br><br>
                                    20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that
                                    hath
                                    life,
                                    and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
                                    <br><br>
                                    21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the
                                    waters
                                    brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind:
                                    and
                                    God
                                    saw that it was good.
                                    <br><br>
                                    22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in
                                    the
                                    seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
                                    <br><br>
                                    23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
                                    <br><br>
                                    24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind,
                                    cattle,
                                    and
                                    creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
                                    <br><br>
                                    25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind,
                                    and
                                    every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was
                                    good.
                                    <br><br>
                                    26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them
                                    have
                                    dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the
                                    cattle,
                                    and
                                    over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
                                    <br><br>
                                    27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male
                                    and
                                    female
                                    created he them.
                                    <br><br>
                                    28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
                                    replenish
                                    the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the
                                    fowl
                                    of
                                    the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
                                    <br><br>
                                    29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon
                                    the
                                    face
                                    of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding
                                    seed; to
                                    you
                                    it shall be for meat.
                                    <br><br>
                                    30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every
                                    thing
                                    that
                                    creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for
                                    meat:
                                    and
                                    it was so.

                                    31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the
                                    evening
                                    and the morning were the sixth day.

                                sight,
                                and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
                                knowledge of good and evil.
                                <br><br>
                                10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and
                                became into four heads.
                                <br><br>
                                11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of
                                Havilah,
                                where there is gold;
                                <br><br>
                                12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

                                13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole
                                land
                                of Ethiopia.

                                14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east
                                of
                                Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
                                <br><br>
                                15 And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and
                                to
                                keep it.

                                16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest
                                freely eat:
                                <br><br>
                                17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in
                                the
                                day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
                                <br><br>
                                18 And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him
                                an
                                help meet for him.
                                <br><br>
                                19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl
                                of
                                the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam
                                called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
                                <br><br>
                                20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of
                                the
                                field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
                                <br><br>
                                21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took
                                one of
                                his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
                                <br><br>
                                22 And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her
                                unto the man.
                                <br><br>
                                23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be
                                called
                                Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

                                24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his

                                and they shall be one flesh.

                                thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall

                                eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed

                                the field;

                                of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

                                22 And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and

                                24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims,

                                a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

                                <br><br>
                                7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth
                                at
                                the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
                                <br><br>
                                8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the
                                field,
                                that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
                                <br><br>
                                9 And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I

                                brother's keeper?

                                10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me
                                from
                                the ground.

                                11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy
                                brother's blood from thy hand;
                                <br><br>
                                12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength;
                                a
                                fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
                                <br><br>
                                13 And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
                                <br><br>
                                14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy
                                face
                                shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall
                                come to
                                pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
                                <br><br>
                                15 And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be
                                taken
                                on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill
                                him.
                                <br><br>
                                16 And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on
                                the
                                east of Eden.

                                17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city,
                                and
                                called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
                                <br><br>
                                18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael:
                                and
                                Methusael begat Lamech.

                                19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of

                                other Zillah.

                                20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as
                                have
                                cattle.
                                <br><br>
                                21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp
                                and
                                organ.

                                22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and
                                iron:
                                and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
                                <br><br>
                                23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech,
                                hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my
                                hurt.
                                <br><br>
                                24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
                                <br><br>
                                25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God,
                                said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
                                <br><br>
                                26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then
                                began
                                men to call upon the name of the Lord.

                                7 And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth;
                                both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth
                                me that I have made them.

                                8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

                                9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his
                                generations, and Noah walked with God.
                                <br><br>
                                10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
                                <br><br>
                                11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
                                <br><br>
                                12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had
                                corrupted his way upon the earth.
                                <br><br>
                                13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is
                                filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
                                <br><br>
                                14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch
                                it within and without with pitch.
                                <br><br>
                                15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be
                                three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty
                                cubits.
                                <br><br>
                                16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and
                                the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third
                                stories shalt thou make it.
                                <br><br>
                                17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all
                                flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the
                                earth shall die.

                                18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou,
                                and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
                                <br><br>
                                19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the
                                ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
                                <br><br>
                                20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing
                                of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them
                                alive.

                                21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee;
                                and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

                                16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with
                                thee.
                                <br><br>
                                17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of
                                fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that
                                they
                                may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
                                <br><br>
                                18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
                                <br><br>
                                19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the
                                earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
                                <br><br>
                                20 And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every
                                clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
                                <br><br>
                                21 And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not
                                again
                                curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil
                                from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
                                <br><br>
                                22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
                                winter, and day and night shall not cease.

                                seen in the cloud:

                                15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living

                                16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the

                                20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

                                21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.

                                22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two
                                brethren without.
                                <br><br>
                                23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went
                                backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and
                                they saw not their father's nakedness.
                                <br><br>
                                24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.

                                25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

                                26 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
                                <br><br>
                                27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall
                                be his servant.
                                <br><br>
                                28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

                                29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.

                                8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his
                                tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar

                                <br><br>
                                11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto
                                Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

                                12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall
                                say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
                                <br><br>
                                13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and
                                my soul shall live because of thee.
                                <br><br>
                                14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the
                                woman that she was very fair.
                                <br><br>
                                15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman
                                was taken into Pharaoh's house.
                                <br><br>
                                16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses,
                                and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
                                <br><br>
                                17 And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai
                                Abram's wife.
                                <br><br>
                                18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why
                                didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
                                <br><br>
                                19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now
                                therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
                                <br><br>
                                20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife,
                                and all that he had.

                                2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
                                <br><br>
                                3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his
                                tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
                                <br><br>
                                4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram
                                called on the name of the Lord.
                                <br><br>
                                5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
                                <br><br>
                                6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their
                                substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
                                <br><br>
                                7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's
                                cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
                                <br><br>
                                8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee,
                                and
                                between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.
                                <br><br>
                                9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou
                                wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right
                                hand, then I will go to the left.
                                <br><br>
                                10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well
                                watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden
                                of
                                the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
                                <br><br>
                                11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they
                                separated themselves the one from the other.
                                <br><br>
                                12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and
                                pitched his tent toward Sodom.
                                <br><br>
                                13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
                                <br><br>
                                14 And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now
                                thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and
                                eastward, and westward:
                                <br><br>
                                15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
                                <br><br>
                                16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the
                                dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
                                <br><br>
                                17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I
                                will
                                give it unto thee.
                                <br><br>
                                18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in
                                Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.

                                1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar,
                                Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;

                                2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab

                                3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.

                                4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

                                5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and
                                smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh

                                7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country

                                8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of

                                with them in the vale of Siddim;

                                9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king

                                <br><br>
                                11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went
                                their way.
                                <br><br>
                                12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and
                                departed.
                                <br><br>
                                13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the
                                plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were
                                confederate with Abram.
                                <br><br>
                                14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained
                                servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
                                <br><br>
                                15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them,
                                and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.

                                16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his
                                goods, and the women also, and the people.
                                <br><br>
                                17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of
                                Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is

                                18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of

                                <br><br>
                                19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of
                                heaven and earth:

                                thyself.
                                <br><br>
                                22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the

                                high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

                                23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take
                                any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

                                24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went
                                with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

                                but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

                                if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

                                9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three
                                years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

                                10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece

                                her mistress was despised in her eyes.

                                and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the Lord judge

                                11 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear

                                son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.

                                17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child

                                19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his

                                make him a great nation.

                                21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at

                                25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of

                                them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
                                <br><br>
                                3 And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray
                                thee, from thy servant:
                                <br><br>
                                4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves
                                under the tree:
                                <br><br>
                                5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall
                                pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast
                                said.
                                <br><br>
                                6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three
                                measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
                                <br><br>
                                7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a
                                young man; and he hasted to dress it.
                                <br><br>
                                8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before
                                them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
                                <br><br>
                                9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
                                <br><br>
                                10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and,
                                lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was
                                behind him.
                                <br><br>
                                11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with
                                Sarah after the manner of women.
                                <br><br>
                                12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have
                                pleasure, my lord being old also?
                                <br><br>
                                13 And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a
                                surety bear a child, which am old?
                                <br><br>
                                14 Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee,
                                according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
                                <br><br>
                                15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but
                                thou didst laugh.
                                <br><br>
                                16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them
                                to bring them on the way.
                                <br><br>
                                17 And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
                                <br><br>
                                18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the
                                nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
                                <br><br>
                                19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and
                                they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may
                                bring
                                upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
                                <br><br>
                                20 And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their
                                sin is very grievous;
                                <br><br>
                                21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry
                                of
                                it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
                                <br><br>
                                22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood
                                yet before the Lord.
                                <br><br>
                                23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the
                                wicked?
                                <br><br>
                                24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and
                                not
                                spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
                                <br><br>
                                25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the
                                wicked:
                                and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the
                                Judge of all the earth do right?
                                <br><br>
                                26 And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will
                                spare all the place for their sakes.
                                <br><br>
                                27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
                                Lord, which am but dust and ashes:
                                <br><br>
                                28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the
                                city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy
                                it.
                                <br><br>
                                29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found
                                there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
                                <br><br>
                                30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure
                                there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty
                                there.
                                <br><br>
                                31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure
                                there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's
                                sake.
                                <br><br>
                                32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once:
                                Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's
                                sake.
                                <br><br>
                                33 And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and
                                Abraham
                                returned unto his place.

                                1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot
                                seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
                                <br><br>
                                2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house,
                                and
                                tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways.
                                And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
                                <br><br>
                                3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his
                                house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
                                <br><br>
                                4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the
                                house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
                                <br><br>
                                5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee
                                this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
                                <br><br>
                                6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
                                <br><br>
                                7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
                                <br><br>
                                8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring
                                them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do
                                nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
                                <br><br>
                                9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn,
                                and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And
                                they
                                pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
                                <br><br>
                                10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to
                                the door.
                                <br><br>
                                11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small
                                and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
                                <br><br>
                                12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and
                                thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
                                <br><br>
                                13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the
                                face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
                                <br><br>
                                14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and
                                said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed
                                as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
                                <br><br>
                                15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy
                                wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of
                                the city.
                                <br><br>
                                16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his
                                wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and
                                they
                                brought him forth, and set him without the city.
                                <br><br>
                                17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape
                                for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the
                                mountain, lest thou be consumed.
                                <br><br>
                                18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:
                                <br><br>
                                19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy
                                mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the
                                mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
                                <br><br>
                                20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me
                                escape
                                thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
                                <br><br>
                                21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I
                                will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
                                <br><br>
                                22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither.
                                Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
                                <br><br>
                                23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
                                <br><br>
                                24 Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord
                                out of heaven;
                                <br><br>
                                25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the
                                cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
                                <br><br>
                                26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
                                <br><br>
                                27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord:
                                <br><br>
                                28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and
                                beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
                                <br><br>
                                29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered
                                Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities
                                in
                                the which Lot dwelt.
                                <br><br>
                                30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with
                                him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
                                <br><br>
                                31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man
                                in
                                the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
                                <br><br>
                                32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may
                                preserve seed of our father.
                                <br><br>
                                33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay
                                with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
                                <br><br>
                                34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold,
                                I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go
                                thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
                                <br><br>
                                35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and
                                lay
                                with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
                                <br><br>
                                36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
                                <br><br>
                                37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of
                                the Moabites unto this day.
                                <br><br>
                                38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the
                                father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

                                1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between
                                Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
                                <br><br>
                                2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar
                                sent, and took Sarah.
                                <br><br>
                                3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but
                                a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
                                <br><br>
                                4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a
                                righteous nation?
                                <br><br>
                                5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my
                                brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
                                <br><br>
                                6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity
                                of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I
                                thee not to touch her.
                                <br><br>
                                7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for
                                thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt
                                surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
                                <br><br>
                                8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told
                                all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
                                <br><br>
                                9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and
                                what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?
                                thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
                                <br><br>
                                10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
                                <br><br>
                                11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place;
                                and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
                                <br><br>
                                12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the
                                daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
                                <br><br>
                                13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I
                                said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place
                                whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
                                <br><br>
                                14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave
                                them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
                                <br><br>
                                15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
                                <br><br>
                                16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of
                                silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and
                                with all other: thus she was reproved.
                                <br><br>
                                17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his
                                maidservants; and they bare children.
                                <br><br>
                                18 For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of
                                Sarah Abraham's wife.

                                7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children

                                gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and
                                she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

                                15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the

                                19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the
                                bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
                                <br><br>
                                20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an
                                archer.
                                <br><br>
                                21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the
                                land of Egypt.
                                <br><br>
                                22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of
                                his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
                                <br><br>
                                23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor
                                with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto
                                thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
                                <br><br>
                                24 And Abraham said, I will swear.
                                <br><br>
                                25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's
                                servants had violently taken away.
                                <br><br>
                                26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me,
                                neither yet heard I of it, but to day.
                                <br><br>
                                27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made
                                a covenant.
                                <br><br>
                                28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
                                <br><br>
                                29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set
                                by themselves?
                                <br><br>
                                30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be
                                a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
                                <br><br>
                                31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
                                <br><br>
                                32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the
                                chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
                                <br><br>
                                33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the Lord,
                                the everlasting God.
                                <br><br>
                                34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

                                1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto
                                him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
                                <br><br>
                                2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee
                                into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the
                                mountains which I will tell thee of.
                                <br><br>
                                3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his
                                young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and
                                rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
                                <br><br>
                                4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
                                <br><br>
                                5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad
                                will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
                                <br><br>
                                6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and
                                he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
                                <br><br>
                                7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I,
                                my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt
                                offering?
                                <br><br>
                                8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so
                                they went both of them together.
                                <br><br>
                                9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar
                                there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar
                                upon the wood.
                                <br><br>
                                10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
                                <br><br>
                                11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham:
                                and he said, Here am I.
                                <br><br>
                                12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him:
                                for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only
                                son from me.
                                <br><br>
                                13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a
                                thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt
                                offering in the stead of his son.
                                <br><br>
                                14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day,
                                In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
                                <br><br>
                                15 And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
                                <br><br>
                                16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this
                                thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
                                <br><br>
                                17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
                                the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed
                                shall possess the gate of his enemies;
                                <br><br>
                                18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast
                                obeyed my voice.
                                <br><br>
                                19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to
                                Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

                                20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold,

                                <br><br>
                                21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
                                <br><br>
                                22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
                                <br><br>
                                23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.

                                24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and
                                Thahash, and Maachah.

                                15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is

                                17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field,
                                and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in
                                all the borders round about, were made sure
                                <br><br>
                                18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all
                                that went in at the gate of his city.
                                <br><br>
                                19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah
                                before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
                                <br><br>
                                20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a
                                possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.

                            <h5>
                                1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed Abraham in
                                all things.
                                <br><br>
                                2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he
                                had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
                                <br><br>
                                3 And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth,
                                that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among
                                whom I dwell:
                                <br><br>
                                4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son
                                Isaac.
                                <br><br>
                                5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow
                                me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou
                                camest?
                                <br><br>
                                6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
                                <br><br>
                                7 The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my
                                kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I
                                give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my
                                son from thence.
                                <br><br>
                                8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from
                                this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
                                <br><br>
                                9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him
                                concerning that matter.
                                <br><br>
                                10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all
                                the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto
                                the city of Nahor.
                                <br><br>
                                11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time
                                of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
                                <br><br>
                                12 And he said O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this
                                day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
                                <br><br>
                                13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city
                                come out to draw water:
                                <br><br>
                                14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher,
                                I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels
                                drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and
                                thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
                                <br><br>
                                15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out,
                                who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her
                                pitcher upon her shoulder.
                                <br><br>
                                16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her:
                                and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
                                <br><br>
                                17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water
                                of thy pitcher.
                                <br><br>
                                18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her
                                hand, and gave him drink.
                                <br><br>
                                19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels
                                also, until they have done drinking.
                                <br><br>
                                20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well
                                to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
                                <br><br>
                                21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had made his
                                journey prosperous or not.
                                <br><br>
                                22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden
                                earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight
                                of gold;
                                <br><br>
                                23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy
                                father's house for us to lodge in?
                                <br><br>
                                24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she
                                bare unto Nahor.
                                <br><br>
                                25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to
                                lodge in.
                                <br><br>
                                26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord.
                                <br><br>
                                27 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left
                                destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the Lord led me to
                                the house of my master's brethren.
                                <br><br>
                                28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.
                                <br><br>
                                29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man,
                                unto the well.
                                <br><br>
                                30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands,
                                and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me;
                                that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
                                <br><br>
                                31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou without? for
                                I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
                                <br><br>
                                32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and
                                provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with
                                him.
                                <br><br>
                                33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have
                                told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
                                <br><br>
                                34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
                                <br><br>
                                35 And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath
                                given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants,
                                and camels, and asses.
                                <br><br>
                                36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him
                                hath he given all that he hath.
                                <br><br>
                                37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the
                                daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
                                <br><br>
                                38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my
                                son.
                                <br><br>
                                39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
                                <br><br>
                                40 And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee,
                                and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my
                                father's house:
                                <br><br>
                                41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if
                                they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
                                <br><br>
                                42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, if now
                                thou do prosper my way which I go:
                                <br><br>
                                43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the
                                virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little
                                water of thy pitcher to drink;
                                <br><br>
                                44 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the
                                same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master's son.
                                <br><br>
                                45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her
                                pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said
                                unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
                                <br><br>
                                46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and
                                I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
                                <br><br>
                                47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of
                                Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face,
                                and the bracelets upon her hands.
                                <br><br>
                                48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my
                                master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's
                                daughter unto his son.
                                <br><br>
                                49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell
                                me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
                                <br><br>
                                50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we
                                cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
                                <br><br>
                                51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's
                                wife, as the Lord hath spoken.
                                <br><br>
                                52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped
                                the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.
                                <br><br>
                                53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and
                                gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
                                <br><br>
                                54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all
                                night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
                                <br><br>
                                55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the
                                least ten; after that she shall go.
                                <br><br>
                                56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me
                                away that I may go to my master.
                                <br><br>
                                57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
                                <br><br>
                                58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she
                                said, I will go.
                                <br><br>
                                59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and
                                his men.
                                <br><br>
                                60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother
                                of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
                                <br><br>
                                61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the
                                man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
                                <br><br>
                                62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
                                <br><br>
                                63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his
                                eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
                                <br><br>
                                64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
                                <br><br>
                                65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to
                                meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and
                                covered herself.
                                <br><br>
                                66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
                                <br><br>
                                67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became
                                his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

                                2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

                                3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and
                                Letushim, and Leummim.
                                <br><br>
                                4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All
                                these were the children of Keturah.
                                <br><br>
                                5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
                                <br><br>
                                6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent
                                them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
                                <br><br>
                                7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred
                                threescore and fifteen years.

                                8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of
                                years; and was gathered to his people.

                                9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of
                                Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;

                                11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and
                                Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

                                12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian,
                                Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
                                <br><br>
                                13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their
                                generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
                                <br><br>
                                14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

                                15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

                                16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by
                                their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
                                <br><br>
                                17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven
                                years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
                                <br><br>
                                18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward
                                Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
                                <br><br>
                                19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
                                <br><br>
                                20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel
                                the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
                                <br><br>
                                21 And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was
                                intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
                                <br><br>
                                22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I
                                thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord.
                                <br><br>
                                23 And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people
                                shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other
                                people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
                                <br><br>
                                24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her
                                womb.
                                <br><br>
                                25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name
                                Esau.
                                <br><br>
                                26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his
                                name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
                                <br><br>
                                27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was
                                a plain man, dwelling in tents.
                                <br><br>
                                28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
                                <br><br>
                                29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
                                <br><br>
                                30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am
                                faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
                                <br><br>
                                31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
                                <br><br>
                                32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this
                                birthright do to me?
                                <br><br>
                                33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his
                                birthright unto Jacob.
                                <br><br>
                                34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and
                                rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.
